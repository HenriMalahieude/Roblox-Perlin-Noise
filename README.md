# Roblox-Perlin-Noise
This project was focused on creating a terrain generator that used the Perlin Noise function as it's primary algorithm. Without using the provided math.noise function, I created the generator in a two version process.

Notes: 
* Most of the code can be found in src/ServerScriptService
* This can be used with the Plugin Rojo to import the files into Roblox Studio

Primary IDE: Roblox Game Engine
